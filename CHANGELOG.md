# Changelog

All notable changes to Modern Format Boost will be documented in this file.

## [6.9.14] - 2025-12-25

### 🔧 No-Loss Design - Failed Files Fallback

- **Failed files now copied**: When conversion fails, original file is copied to output
- **XMP merged for failed files**: XMP sidecars merged even for failed conversions
- **Build fix**: Added `build.rs` for dynamic Homebrew library path detection (dav1d/libheif)
- **Loud error reporting**: All failures reported with clear messages

## [6.9.13] - 2025-12-25

### 🔧 No-Loss Design - Core Implementation

- **Moved to core program**: Copy unsupported files + verification now in Rust code
- **New module**: `shared_utils/file_copier.rs` - handles file copying and verification
- **Functions**: `copy_unsupported_files()`, `count_all_files()`, `verify_output_completeness()`
- **Shell script simplified**: Only UI/wrapper, logic moved to main programs
- **Verification**: Automatic output completeness check after directory processing

## [6.9.12] - 2025-12-25

### 🔧 Format Support Enhancement + Validation Mechanism

- **Added image formats**: `.jpe`, `.jfif` (JPEG variants)
- **Added video formats**: `.wmv`, `.flv`
- **Output integrity verification**: Compares input/output file counts after processing
  - Reports missing files with clear warnings
  - Detects unsupported formats (`.psd`, RAW files) and reports them
- **Updated**: `imgquality_hevc`, `imgquality_av1`, `shared_utils/batch.rs`, `drag_and_drop_processor.sh`

## [6.9.11] - 2025-12-25

### 🔧 XMP Sidecar Merge for Skipped Files

- **Fixed: Skipped files now have XMP sidecars merged**
  - Previously, files skipped (short animations, modern formats, quality failures) were copied without XMP metadata
  - Now `merge_xmp_for_copied_file()` is called after copying to merge XMP sidecars
  - Affects: short animations (<3s), modern lossy formats (WebP/AVIF/HEIC), quality validation failures
  - Added new helper function `shared_utils::merge_xmp_for_copied_file()` for reuse

## [6.9.10] - 2025-12-25

### 🔧 XMP Sidecar Merge Fix

- **Fixed false-positive XMP merge failures for JXL files**
  - ExifTool outputs `[minor] Will wrap JXL codestream in ISO BMFF container` as informational message
  - Previously this was incorrectly treated as an error
  - PNG→JXL conversions with XMP sidecars now report `✅ XMP sidecar merged successfully`

### 🔧 Quality Validation Error Message Fix

- **Fixed misleading error messages when video stream compression fails**
  - Previously showed `SSIM X < Y` even when SSIM was actually higher than threshold
  - Root cause: `quality_passed=false` due to video stream not compressing, not SSIM failure
  - Now correctly shows `VIDEO STREAM COMPRESSION FAILED` with size details
  - Accurate distinction between: compression failure / SSIM calculation failure / SSIM below threshold

## [6.5.2] - 2025-12-20

### 🔧 Adjacent Directory Mode Fix

- **Copy original when skipped**: Fixed issue where skipped files were missing from output directory
  - Short animations (< 3s) now copied to output directory instead of being silently skipped
  - Videos that cannot be compressed (VP8, already optimized) now copied to output directory
  - Modern formats (WebP, AVIF, HEIC) skipped but copied to preserve directory completeness
  
- **Quality Protection with Copy**: When video stream compression fails:
  - Original file protected (not replaced with larger file)
  - Original copied to output directory in adjacent mode
  - Clear logging with `📋 Copied original to output dir` message

### 🎯 VP8 Source Compression Fix

- **Added VP8 codec detection**: VP8 sources now properly identified with efficiency factor 0.85
  - Previously VP8 was treated as `Unknown` (efficiency 1.0), causing CRF underestimation
  - VP8 → HEVC conversion now starts with more appropriate (higher) CRF values
  - Improved chance of achieving compression for VP8 sources

### 📊 GPU Coarse Search Range Expansion

- **Expanded GPU max CRF**: 40 → 48
  - GPU phase now explores a wider CRF range
  - Better compression boundary detection for already-efficient codecs (VP8, VP9)
  - Reduces "GPU didn't find compression boundary" failures

### 🎬 Comprehensive Codec Support

- **Added 15+ legacy and lossless codecs** to prevent "Unknown codec" efficiency mismatches:
  - **Legacy Video**: MPEG-4 (XviD/DivX), MPEG-2 (DVD), MPEG-1 (VCD), WMV/VC-1, Theora, RealVideo, Flash Video
  - **Lossless Video**: RawVideo, Lagarith, MagicYUV
  - **Image Formats**: BMP, TIFF
  
- **Efficiency factors calibrated for all codecs**:
  | Codec | Efficiency Factor | Notes |
  |-------|------------------|-------|
  | MPEG-4 | 1.3 | ~30% less efficient than H.264 |
  | MPEG-2 | 1.8 | ~80% less efficient (DVD era) |
  | MPEG-1 | 2.5 | Very old (VCD era) |
  | WMV/VC-1 | 1.1 | Similar to H.264 |
  | Theora | 1.2 | Similar to MPEG-4 ASP |
  | RealVideo | 2.0 | Ancient, very inefficient |
  | Flash Video | 1.5 | FLV1/VP6 legacy |

## [6.9.1] - 2025-12-19

### 🎵 Smart Audio Transcoding Strategy

- **Quality-aware audio handling**: Intelligent codec selection based on source quality
  - High-quality/Lossless (>256kbps, FLAC, PCM) → ALAC (Apple Lossless)
  - Medium-quality (128-256kbps) → AAC 256kbps
  - Low-quality (<128kbps) → AAC 192kbps
  - Compatible codecs → Direct copy (`-c:a copy`)

- **FFprobe audio detection**: New fields for quality analysis
  - `audio_bit_rate`: Audio bitrate in bps
  - `audio_sample_rate`: Sample rate in Hz
  - `audio_channels`: Channel count

- **VP9/WebM compatibility fix**: Opus/Vorbis audio now properly transcoded for MOV/MP4 containers
